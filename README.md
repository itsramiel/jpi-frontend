## JPI (Jokanda Property Investement) Frontend

I worked on JPI as a fullstack developer. 

In this project I:
- built the frontend using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and react server components with focus on SEO for search engine reaches
- designed the UI from scratch using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)(see screenshots below)

- Projects page with pagination of different offered properties
- Blog page to allow for better reach and seo
- Contact form which sends messages to the backend CMS

Localization, LTR, and RTL support âœ…
